## gnucash import converter

Convert random .csv formats to allow importing invoice line items to Gnucash.  
This version works with export format for Hours Tracker Android App (cribasoft LLC) 
but it should be easy to customize to other .csv files. 

The *intended use case* is when you are invoicing a customer for hours worked.
